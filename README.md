# Imageclassifier
Animal Image Classifier Using CNN
This project is a multi-class image classification system that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify and classify 10 different animal species from images.

üß† Project Overview
The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras on a dataset containing images of:

Butterfly
Cat
Chicken
Cow
Dog
Elephant
Horse
Sheep
Spider
Squirrel

The classifier can predict the correct animal from any uploaded image and was built as part of an internship project to explore deep learning and computer vision techniques.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Python
TensorFlow & Keras
Google Colab (for training and testing)
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
ImageDataGenerator for preprocessing
Matplotlib for visualization
